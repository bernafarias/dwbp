      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>One of the main goals of the Data on the Web Best Practices ([DWBP]) is to facilitate interaction between publishers and consumers of data on the Web. A set of 35 Data on the Web Best Practices was created to cover different aspects related to data publishing and consumption, such as metadata, data licenses, data provenance, data quality, data versioning, data identifiers, data formats, data vocabularies, data access and APIs, data preservation, feedback, data enrichment, and republication. To show that the DWBP are implementable and broadly adopted and referenced, we adopted the following strategies:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>We have documented the existence of multiple evidences to show that a given best practice has been adopted by renewed organizations when publishing or consuming data on the Web. An evidence can be of different types, including: datasets; data portals; documents; references; guidelines; good practices.</li>
        <li>We have shown that each one of the proposed DWBP is implementable. Therefore, we have documented the existence of at least two implementations demonstrating the feasibility of the DWBP.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Evidence or implementation should cover one or more of the DWBP, regardless the strategy. During the implementation phase we looked for existing evidences as well as new implementations. This information was gathered as follows:</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>This report summarizes both surveys results and implementation details.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>To collect evidences for the DWBP, we used the following methodology:</p>
        <p>Collecting evidences: a standard email was sent to several organizations around the world. After collecting some evidences, it was verified that some Best Practices, like the ones related to data Preservation, didn't have a lot of evidences. Then, in order to fill in these gaps we made contact with specific members from the working group asking for help to collecting evidences for specific DWBP. We classified the evidences as follows:</p>
        <p><strong>Datasets</strong>, <strong>Data Portals</strong> and <strong>Vocabularies</strong>: this category concerns datasets, data portals and vocabularies available on the Web. The idea is to show that the DWBP were already considered by organizations responsible for publishing the data. A datasets may be available on data catalogues and data portals may be implemented using technologies like CKAN and Socrata. In some cases, proprietary technologies were used to make the data available on the Web. We also considered vocabularies as an evidence for the DWBP. It is important to note that publishing a vocabulary can be considered as specific case of publishing data on the Web.</p>
        <p><strong>Documents</strong> and <strong>References</strong>: this category includes Web sites, Web pages, blogs, published papers,APIs documentation, wikis, etc, that show the relevance of the DWBP. For some DWBP was more difficult to find evidences on the form of datasets and data portals. Then we also considered other types of evidences that could show the relevance of a specific DWBP. Like this, we can show that even when a given BP has not been broadly implemented and it is relevant and it should also be considered as BP.</p>

        <h3>Meeting the exit criteria</h3>
        <p>As noted in the DWBP charter, to move on to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be adduced in order to demonstrate that each of the best practices has been recommended or adopted in at least two environments, such as data portals and formal policies. Evidence of implementation was gathered from existing datasets, which have already implemented the proposed best practices, as well as from national or sector-specific guidelines that reference the DWBP.</p>
